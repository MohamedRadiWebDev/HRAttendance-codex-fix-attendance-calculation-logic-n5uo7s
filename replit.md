# HR Attendance & Payroll System

## Overview

This is an HR Attendance and Payroll Management System built for Arabic-speaking organizations. The application provides comprehensive employee management, biometric attendance tracking, Excel-based data import/export, configurable attendance rules, and leave/adjustment management. The entire UI is designed with RTL (Right-to-Left) layout support for Arabic language users.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight client-side routing)
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state, with custom hooks for data fetching
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with RTL support, custom Arabic fonts (Cairo, Tajawal)
- **Charts**: Recharts for dashboard analytics
- **Excel Processing**: xlsx library for client-side Excel file parsing

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js 5 with TypeScript
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API with typed routes defined in shared/routes.ts
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between client and server via drizzle-zod integration
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for server bundling

### Data Storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (required, configured via DATABASE_URL environment variable)
- **Schema Location**: shared/schema.ts contains all table definitions
- **Key Tables**:
  - `employees`: Employee master data with Arabic names, department, shift info
  - `biometricPunches`: Raw biometric attendance stamps
  - `attendanceRecords`: Processed daily attendance with hours, penalties, overtime
  - `excelTemplates`: Configurable Excel import/export column mappings
  - `specialRules`: Priority-based attendance rules (custom shifts, exemptions)
  - `adjustments`: Leave records, missions, permissions

### Shared Code Pattern
- TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas are defined in the `shared/` directory
- Both client and server import from shared modules for type safety
- API route definitions in shared/routes.ts ensure consistent typing across the stack

### Key Design Decisions
1. **RTL-First Design**: The entire application uses Arabic as the primary language with RTL layout baked into the CSS base
2. **Template-Based Excel Processing**: Flexible column mapping system allows different Excel formats for attendance data import
3. **Rule Priority System**: Special rules have priority levels and scopes (all employees, department-specific, individual) for flexible attendance policy configuration
4. **Typed API Layer**: Route definitions include input/output Zod schemas for end-to-end type safety
5. **Timezone-Aware Attendance Processing**: Client sends timezoneOffsetMinutes with attendance processing requests so the server computes shift start times and day boundaries correctly in the user's local timezone, preventing incorrect lateness detection caused by UTC conversions

### Date Handling
- **Date Input Format**: The UI accepts dd/MM/yyyy format for user convenience
- **Date Persistence**: Attendance page date ranges are persisted to localStorage and URL query params
- **Timezone-Aware Imports**: Punch timestamps are formatted with timezone information (yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXX) during import
- **Safe Pagination**: Attendance queries handle unbounded pagination (limit <= 0 skips DB pagination)

## External Dependencies

### Database
- PostgreSQL (required) - Connection via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Drizzle Kit for migrations (`npm run db:push`)

### Third-Party Libraries
- **xlsx**: Excel file reading/writing for import/export functionality
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation for attendance calculations
- **connect-pg-simple**: PostgreSQL session storage (if sessions are implemented)

### UI Component Dependencies
- Radix UI primitives (dialogs, dropdowns, forms, etc.)
- Recharts for data visualization
- Lucide React for icons
- Embla Carousel for carousel components

### Development Tools
- Vite with React plugin for frontend development
- Replit-specific plugins for development experience (cartographer, dev-banner, error overlay)
